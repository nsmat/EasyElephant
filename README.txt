#### EasyElephant ####

EasyElephant comes in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way to open the file is to install the Anaconda Python Distribution,
found here: https://www.anaconda.com/. I recommend installing Python 2.7, since that is what EasyElephant was written in, but it
should also work in Python 3.x.

All instructions for running the analysis are within the Jupyter Notebook itself.
